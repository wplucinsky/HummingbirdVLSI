# HummingbirdVLSI
This project aims to implement the [Hummingbird Cryptographic Algorithm](https://github.com/wplucinsky/HummingbirdVLSI/blob/master/HummingbirdAlgorithm.pdf) which was created at the University of Waterloo [1] for Drexel University's ECEC 472 - Custom VLSI Design class.  My team implemented only the encryption module, seen below, due to time constraints.

The 45nm NanGate Open Cell Library, [FreePDK45](http://www.nangate.com/?page_id=2325), standard cells were used which were created with PMOS_VTH and NMOS_VTH transistors. No automatic schematic or layout tools were used.
